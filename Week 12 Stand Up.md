## Digital Prototype - User Testing:

The results of the user testing are: https://github.com/deco3500-2017/TeamSupreme/blob/master/User%20testing%20-%20Digital%20prototype.pdf

In terms of the user testing, we performed tests on students and we gave them the following scenario:
Suppose you are coming to UQ and are wanting to study in a specific room but are unsure whether the room is free or if there is class going on. 

We asked the user to play around the app with the location selected as UQ and view other questions asked as well as their corresponding answers. We then came back to the scenario and asked the user to perform the task of asking the question. Most users were able to successfully find the 'ask question' button however one user did suggest to make it more prominent as it was not easily noticed by them. As they went through the process of asking the question we asked them about their thoughts on the process and whether they would change anything about it. All users were happy with the minimal amount of settings they had to put when asking the question. For the categories section we got some useful feedback on the types of categories to include these consisted of; parking, libraries, facilities, street markets, entertainment, and opening hours. Another good suggestion for the questions page was to include an urgent question so these questions would appear first as unanswered and would aim to get a faster reply than usual questions. However we do not want this feature to be misused and may add some restrictions on the number of times a user can use it. Lastly, for the questions page, to confirm and post the answer we have a pop-up indicating the amount of points the user is spending and the balance remaining once the points have been spent. For this feature, some users commented on it being too wordy and it can be displayed in a more simpler way possibly with visuals. Next, once the user had asked the question we then asked them to suppose that they are another user who is currently in the room and is able to answer the question asked. All users conducted this task with ease as they were all easily able to indicate where they have to go to answer the question and how to answer it. Hence the general process of asking and answering questions was user friendly for all users with some minor improvements we can make to enhance the process further.
