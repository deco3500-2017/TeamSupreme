## Low Fidelity User Testing
The purpose of user testing the paper prototypes was to understand what others thought of our concept and if there are any improvements we could make. From the results, (https://github.com/deco3500-2017/TeamSupreme/blob/master/paper%20prototype/User%20testing%20-%20Paper%20prototype.pdf) it is seen that most users liked the concept and found it to be innovative as it entices community engagement. Improvements that were suggested was better placement of buttons and other objects to cater for a more user friendly experience. As well as showing a list of popular places in the form of a radar around the location of the user. The initial concept of the point system was that you earn a set of points for answering questions and then you are able to use those points to ask a question. After user testing this idea was agreed with but there were some suggestions given. For example the question poster provides a set number of points for whoever answers the question. Other users will be able to up vote answers or expand on existing answers and in the end the question poster will have the final say on who has the best answer and they will receive the points. In terms of notifications, we may consider adding a setting which allows the user to select the timeframes (e.g. Every 15 mins, every 30 mins) for when they want notifications. Another notification setting would be to only get notified if the question poster is offering a large amount of points. One main concern for the group was deciding how long each question should stay on the app and a good suggestion for this was to include a category option when asking questions. The categories will be things like queues, facilities, or opening hours. Each category will have a set time, for example, queue questions will only be relevant for a maximum of 30 minutes whereas questions around facilities can remain for an entire day. Overall the user testing of paper prototypes gave us a good insight on what users think of the app and what improvements we can make to ensure a user-friendly experience. 

**Description of what each team member has done and what they are planning to do before the next standup:** 

### Sanika Naik
**I have done** preparation for user testing of the paper prototypes by setting up a range of tasks we would ask the user to do followed by a short questionnaire on the overall concept. I also conducted the user testing and analysed the results which could be applied to the digital prototype. Moreover, I did A/B testing of what selection screen users prefer(images below), whether they like the map view and being able to find locations or prefer a list view. The results of this were that all tested users preferred the map view as they found it easy to find nearby places to their location and it is more user friendly to be able to zoom in and out of specific areas.

**I am planning to** refine the digital prototype and conduct user testing of the digital prototype.

### (Carol) Shui Yan

### Bosco Bartilomo

### Matt Moss

**I have done** creating the digital prototype with Adobe XD which implemented feedback we received from user testing of the paper prototype. The digital prototype is a click through prototype which details the user interface and the flow of actions the user will undertake when using AskLocal. This prototype has been passed onto Sanika to finalise before we use it for user testing.

**I am planning to** work on the styling and front-end code of the design prototype for the final package. Currently this prototype is just a functional tech prototype but has no real interface. I will be working on this with Liam. 

### Liam Buttery

**I have done** The mockups for the notifications, this was done on the IOS mobile system with the use of photoshop. I have also completed the Logo for our app.

**I am planning to** Work with Matt in the front end coding and implementation of the design prototype.
