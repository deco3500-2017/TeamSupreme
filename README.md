# TeamSupreme Proposal 
## Introduction
## Concept
## Team
The team consists of 5 members that are proficient in UI and UX design. The team leader is Matt, he will be responsible to lead and manage the project. As there are 4 designers, each member will have a specific role in relation to the design process such as; creating mockups and wireframes, creating prototypes, conducting user testing, ensuring a good user interface design and a good user experience. Every individual in the group will be responsible for different logistics. In particular, Carol will be responsible for organizing equipments, especially while conducting prototypes for user testing. Sanika will find the most suitable time for all group members to attend group meetings. Bosco will handle most of the programming and backend tasks. Liam will be responsible for ensuring all steps of the design process have been undertaken correctly. 

Team Member | Roles and Responsibilities
------------|--------------
Matthew Moss (43231454) | UI/UX Design & Front End Development
Liam Buttery (43531538) | UI/UX Design & Content
(Carol) Shui Yan (43801642) | User Interface Design
Sanika Naik (43949263) | UI/UX Design
Bosco Bartilomo (4356893) | Back End Developer

### Decision Making
All decisions around the project will be brought up and discussed in team meetings. After the potential decision is presented, discussion around whether it should be implemented or how to improve it are had. All members will receive the chance to voice their opinions and we will aim to reach a collective decision by the end. Most decisions will be finalised through a majority vote if no consensus is reached by the end of the meeting. 
### Conflict Resolution
Any conflicts within the group can be brought up at a team meeting, and the root of the conflict can be confronted directly in a polite and open way. If a team member is underperforming, they will be asked reasons as to why they may not be contributing equally. If the member is unsure of how to complete a task it is their responsibility to talk with the leader and the rest of the team to seek for help. Failure for any change to occur after the problem has been presented in the team meeting will result in an email sent to the course coordinator, Lorna. The email will outline the source of the problem, potential solutions that have been implemented/attempted and the reason as to why these attempts failed. If no further action is taken then a meeting will be set up with Laura to deal with the conflict.

## Communication
The team will meet regularly every Tuesday workshop and other meeting times will be discussed if needed. As all members of the team are actively on Facebook, we will use Facebook messenger as the main communication tool outside of class. All files related to the project will be stored and shared through Google Drive. The team will also use the GitHub repository provided by the university. In terms of file naming conventions, all files will be named clearly with the filename briefly describing what the file is.
