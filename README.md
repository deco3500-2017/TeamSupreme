## 2. Prototype 
Link to prototype: https://asklocal.uqcloud.net/ 
You can visit this on your mobile however it is recommended to view it on a desktop as some icons and buttons may appear small on a mobile screen. The final implementation is meant to be a mobile application however for testing purposes a web app was better suitable. 
Once on the web app, you can login with your name and input any password you like. There is no authentication as we did not want to spend time getting users to register a new account before they login at the showcase. Next, you can choose a location on the map or from the list displayed underneath the map. This selection will take you to the questions page where you can view questions that have been asked with links to their answers below. You can ask a new question for the location or you can view the answers for any previously asked question. On the answers page, there are buttons below each answer to vote up or down. Voting up increases the answerâ€™s rating and voting down reduces the score. The answer with the highest score will be displayed at the top as it will be seen as the most reliable. At any point on the web app you can use the top navigation buttons to go back to the home page, log out, or view your profile. On the profile page you can see your profile image as well as your points which allow you to ask questions. 

## 3. Summary:
### Problem
The problem space chosen by the team is Active Communities, the team has focused on solving the delay in response times and lack of information of specific locations.   
### Solution
 AskLocal aims to address this problem by providing a real time question and answer platform.  
## 4. Process: 
### User Research 
The initial idea for AskLocal was made by Matt, it aims to solve the problem that users being able to ask questions about one specific location and it can be answered by people who are actually in the location or has been to the location. The users are able to choose questions from map and users will get notification if a question has been asked nearby.
#### Paper Prototype
As it is the very fisrt prototype, it was paper based and has only introduced very basic and primary feature of AskLocal. It has the question posting and answeing function for user to test. Furthermore, a notification page was designed to demonstrate how the app encourages user to answer questions to get points. 

#### Digital Prototype
It is a digital click through made by Adobe XD to display all the functions of AskLocal. This prototype contains a few now pages: login page, personal profile page, question view page and location information page. It also contains a group of new functions, such as voting system and set point, category and duration while asking questions. 

#### Final Prototype
functional, Users are required to login to use the application. However, for future, we will have a register page as well as the ability to login with google or facebook. This app allows users to post and answer questions by clicking a certain location on map., as well as voting the best question you like. The user could also check up their points by go to their personal profile. 

### User Testing
User testing was conducted after each of the prototype, the feedbacks were collected and evaluated. User testing was a primary tool the team used for refining existing idea and enhance user experience. All the user testings were conducted in a face to face environment to get the most accurate possible results. 
#### Paper Prototype
First Prototype 
Participants: 3
The first user testing session was conducted to test paper prototype. It aims to test the interface of the application and to see whether we can add more unique functions. It also tested whether the user can be able to easily use the application (such as, how easy to find the button to post question). 
The session has recieved lots of valuable feedback on visual design and usablity. All the testers are able to use the map to ask questions. The concept was acceptable and the app needs to have a menu bar on the top to better navigate users. All the users liked the point system and most users suggested to allow the poster gets to decide how the points divided to each user. Also, the poster should able to decide how long should the question remain on the app.

#### Digital Prototype
Second Prototype
Participants: 5
The second user testing was conducted to test the click through prototype. It was focused on the functional aspect of AskLocal. Users are required to read a snario before user testing. We have got feedbacks on what the users are expect to see on location page. We have also recived feedback on categories while posting questions.

#### Final Prototype
The third user testing for functional prototype was conducted in the exhibition, we have got lots of helpful feedback from peers and tutors for future develop.
