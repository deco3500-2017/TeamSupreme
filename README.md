# TeamSupreme Proposal 
## Introduction
## Concept
## Team
### Conflict Resolution
Any conflicts within the group can be brought up at a team meeting, and the root of the conflict can be confronted directly in a polite and open way. If a team member is underperforming, they will be asked reasons as to why they may not be contributing equally. If the member is unsure of how to complete a task it is their responsibility to talk with the leader and the rest of the team. Failure for any change to occur after the problem has been presented in the team meeting will result in an email sent to the course coordinator, Lorna. The email will outline the source of the problem, potential solutions that have been implemented/attempted and the reason as to why these attempts failed. If no further action is taken then a meeting will be set up with Laura to deal with the conflict.

## Communication
The team will meet regularly every Tuesday workshop and other meeting times will be discussed if needed. As all members of the team are actively on Facebook, we will use Facebook messenger as the main communication tool outside of class. All files related to the project will be stored and shared through Google Drive. The team will also use the GitHub repository provided by the university. In terms of file naming conventions, all files will be named clearly with the filename briefly describing what the file is.
