**Team communication:**

-**Meeting:** We have had one meeting before the pitch to ensure we have a clear idea of the application and what we will be pitching. 

-**Google Docs:** We have been using google drive for all files and ideas sharing and transferred any required items to this GitHub repository. 

-**Facebook Messenger:** Our main communication method has been through Facebook Messenger group chat to keep everyone up to date of the work being completed. 

**User Research:**

We conducted some initial user research through the use of google forms. The aim of this survey was to understand what users currently use to find information about specific locations and whether that information is sufficient to them. As per the results of this survey, it is seen that Google is used by every respondent followed by some searching on Facebook or asking friends. Another question from the survey allowed us to understand the types of information people search for, these were mainly; opening hours, address and images.  This information allows us to know what types of data we should make available to people when they are using the AskLocal app. Another major finding was that approximately 90% of the respondents search for information about the location before going to the location. This is a great advantage for our application as it ensures that people always want to look up the location before going to it and our application will aim to include all data that the user requires.  

**Before next Stand-up:**

As a team, before the next stand-up, we hope to have some user testing done with the paper prototypes so that we are able to use those results to create a digital click-through prototype and do some more user testing.
